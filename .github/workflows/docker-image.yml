    # The command to run to get the file changes can contain {globs} and {branchName} to specify replacements. {globs} uses glob-template to prepare the globs before replacement.

    # A map with keys ADDED, CHANGED, and DELETED as keys and a pattern object ({"pattern": "<pattern>"}) as a value. Any defined keys will be kept, others discarded. Special characters should be escaped. The matching is done by checking if the file change starts with the pattern.
